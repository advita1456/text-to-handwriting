## how I intend to use it.
4000 words for 5 marks is simply unacceptable and that for survey portion. I have absolutely no interest on it. So i am copying and pasting articles. After formatting, i will print it and scan using camscanner, which will produce artifacts by itself. 
Last step is to Send. I will get suggestion from friends then send it.
